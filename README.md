# Red Heat Weather App

Welcome to the Red Heat Weather App! This application is built using React and leverages the OpenWeatherMap API to provide accurate weather information.

## Features

- **City Selection**: Choose your location from a list of cities with an intuitive search field that offers suggestions.
- **Current Weather**: View the current weather conditions for your selected city, fetched directly from the API.
- **7-Day Forecast**: Get a detailed weather forecast for the next seven days.

## Getting Started

To get started with the app, you'll need to install the necessary dependencies. Run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This command will start the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will automatically reload if you make any edits, and you will see any lint errors in the console.

## Acknowledgements

This project was inspired by a tutorial from freeCodeCamp.org. You can check out their video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Reny0cTTv24&t=56s) and the original repository [here](https://github.com/bobangajicsm/react-weather-app).

We have incorporated various elements from the tutorial, including code snippets, layout, and design solutions, while also adding our own enhancements such as formatting and conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

## Keys

The service utilizes APIs from rapidapi.com and openweathermap.org. The current project build includes test keys. If these keys expire by the time you access the project, you will need to generate your own API keys and insert them into the designated fields in the api-keys.js file.
